    content: `The Rocket Pool Tour is excited to announce a groundbreaking partnership with Railbirds, the innovative fan-to-fan wagering platform that's transforming how sports fans engage with live competition.

Railbirds enables fans to make real-time wagers with each other during RPT matches, creating an interactive viewing experience that brings the excitement of the rail—the traditional gathering place for pool spectators—into the digital age.

"Railbirds is the perfect partner for the Rocket Pool Tour," said Ed "EJ" Glode, Co-Founder. "Pool has always been a sport where fans watch closely and discuss every shot. Railbirds takes that tradition and enhances it with modern technology, creating engagement opportunities that simply don't exist in other sports."

The Rocket Run-Out© format's precision scoring system and rapid gameplay make it ideal for in-match wagering. Fans will be able to bet on everything from individual rack outcomes to break percentages to run-out attempts—all in real time as matches unfold.

"The RPT's statistical accuracy is a game-changer for fan engagement," said the Railbirds team. "With the Rocket Run-Out format, we can offer betting opportunities that are both exciting and fair, backed by real data."

The Railbirds integration will launch alongside Season One in Q2 2026, giving fans an unprecedented level of engagement with professional pool.

    excerpt: 'An inside look at the development of the Rocket Pool Tour\'s revolutionary statistics tracking system that will change professional billiards forever.',
    content: `The Rocket Pool Tour is hard at work developing what will become the first comprehensive, accurate statistics engine in professional pool history—and it's going to change everything about how we understand the sport.

"For decades, pool has lacked the statistical depth of other professional sports," explains Rodney "Rocket" Morris, Co-Founder and Tour Commissioner. "We've had win-loss records and maybe some rough estimates, but nothing like what you see in basketball, baseball, or golf. The Rocket Run-Out© format finally makes true statistical tracking possible."

The RPT Stats Engine will track dozens of metrics for every player, every rack, and every shot:
- Break percentages and efficiency
- Run-out success rates by position
- Ball-in-hand conversion rates
- Second-suit run frequency
- Average points per rack
- Pressure performance metrics
- Head-to-head matchup analytics
- And much more

This data will power everything from fan engagement features to broadcast graphics to advanced betting opportunities with partners like Railbirds. It will also help players analyze their performance in unprecedented detail.

"We're building this in phases," said Ed Glode, Co-Founder. "The foundation is launching with Season One, but we're already planning features that will make this the most sophisticated stats platform in cue sports history."

The Stats Engine will integrate directly with the RPT website, mobile apps, and partner platforms, providing real-time data during live matches and comprehensive historical analytics.

Initial launch targeted for Q2 2026 alongside Season One. Full platform rollout planned for Season Two.`,

    slug: 'rocket-runout-explained',
    excerpt: 'Learn about the innovative game format that\'s changing professional billiards forever.',
    content: `The Rocket Run-Out© format represents a paradigm shift in professional pool, designed from the ground up to maximize excitement, statistical precision, and fan engagement.

Created by World Champion Rodney Morris and business strategist Ed Glode, the format is part of the Saratoga series—a hybrid of 8-ball and 9-ball that creates continuous offensive opportunities and dramatic scoring possibilities.

How It Works:
- 9 balls racked in a diamond formation (1-4, 8, 9-12)
- Players select stripes or solids after the break
- Balls must be pocketed in rotation within the chosen group
- Scoring: Break and run (10 points), Ball-in-hand run (7 points), Second-suit run (5 points), or 1-4 points for balls pocketed

This creates a dynamic game where every shot matters, comebacks are always possible, and statistics tell a complete story of player performance.

"For the first time in pool history, we have a format that enables true, accurate statistics," Morris explained. "That opens doors to modern sports analytics, fan engagement, and betting opportunities that have never existed in our sport."

The format has been extensively tested and refined over multiple years, and is now ready for its professional debut in the Rocket Pool Tour.`,
